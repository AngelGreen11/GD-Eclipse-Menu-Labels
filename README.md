# GD Eclipse Menu Labels
Here are some labels I made for the Geometry Dash Eclipse mod. Most of these are small additions to the already existing presets, but some are more complex.

## Importing
Open the Eclipse mod menu and press the "Import Label" button in the Labels tab. Then, navigate to your downloads folder and select the .ecl file.

## Editing
There's an official guide on making labels at https://github.com/EclipseMenu/EclipseMenu/blob/main/LABELS.md. I also made a description for every label that describes what it does and some things you might want to change, you can find them in the [LABELINFO.md](LABELINFO.md) file.
