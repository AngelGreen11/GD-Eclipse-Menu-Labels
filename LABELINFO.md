# Label Info
Some labels use "useless" settings, more info at the bottom of this file.  

## 2P CPS
* **CPS counter with platformer and 2P support.**

(Code) 2P toggle: use a "useless" setting to enable the 2P mode, by default Unlock Shops.  
(Event) On button hold: turns the label green when you click.  
> Known problem: Eclipse doesn't have a way to check if a level is 2P, so the label's 2P mode also activates for 1P duals.


## Best Run
* **Best run in session.** If the run is from 0%, it will only show the run's end.

(Event) New best run: turns the label blue when you're currently getting a new best run (when is not cheating or freeze best run in safe mode is off).
